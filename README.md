# Sentiment-analysis-of-twitter-
This project aims to detect hate speech, specifically racist and sexist content, in Twitter data. It involves preprocessing the data, identifying the most frequently used words, and detecting the presence of racist and sexist language.
# Project Structure
The project comprises the following key components:

Data Collection: Twitter data is collected using the Twitter API or pre-existing datasets.

Preprocessing: Text data undergoes preprocessing, including lowercasing, tokenization, removal of stop words, and handling of special characters and emojis.

Most Used Words: The most frequently used words in the dataset are identified to gain insights into common language patterns.

Hate Speech Detection: Machine learning or deep learning models are trained to classify tweets as racist, sexist, or neutral based on the presence of hate speech.

Racist and Sexist Word Detection: Techniques are applied to identify racist and sexist language within the dataset.
